In order to run this program you need to have the Docker engine installed:

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/

Once you have Docker installed, run the "docker compose up" command in this directory (the one with the docker-compose.yaml)

Make sure the exposed ports on your host are available! (80 and 8000)

Go to http://localhost:80 and login with:

username = krouge
password = contrasenia
